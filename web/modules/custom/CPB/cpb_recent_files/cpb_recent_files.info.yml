# field_my_file -- required field
#
# WARNING: Not strictly a dependency, but PLEASE know that this module won't work for
# you unless you have a content type with a field called 'field_my_file'.
#
# Two ways to solve this in a generic way, given more time:
#
# 1. What I've always done in previous D7 modules, just pre-install this field in the
# {my_module}.install file using hook_schema() or hook_install().
#
# 2. More elegant, less prescriptive: add a selector for this field property on the admin
# config page. Also make sure that we write something in hook_install() to ensure the
# module cannot be enabled without it.
